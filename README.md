# Seam-Carving
Language used: JAVA.
This project uses the algs4 library from Princeton University, which can be downloaded as a .jar here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
Seam-carving is an image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row; a horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.
This code can find the vertical seam and horizontal seam of any image and then the seam can be removed to resize the image.
This is an application related to graphs processing. Finding the shortest path in a graph is a very important application.
The graph here is a DAG.
Each vertex is a pixel and each pixel has a weight equal to its energy function.
